# TON Router Smart Contract

The Router contract facilitates token swaps, liquidity provision, and pool management on the TON blockchain. Below are the supported actions with their opcodes and parameters.

## Actions

### Initialization (`data`)

- **Result**: Returns a `Cell` containing the serialized initial data.

### Set Fees (`setFees`)
- **Opcode**: `0x355423e5`

- **Parameters**: None.
- **Result**: Resets the code upgrade process, discarding the proposed new code.
- **Restrictions**: Can only be called by the admin (`admin_address`).

### Cancel Admin Upgrade (`cancelAdminUpgrade`)
- **Opcode**: `0xa4ed9981`
- **Purpose**: Cancels a previously proposed admin change.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Result**: Resets the admin upgrade process, keeping the current admin address.
- **Restrictions**: Can only be called by the current admin (`admin_address`).

### Finalize Upgrades (`finalizeUpgrades`)
- **Opcode**: `0x6378509f`
- **Purpose**: Completes the upgrade process for code and/or admin address changes.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Result**: Applies the proposed code and/or admin address updates to the contract state.
- **Restrictions**: Can only be called by the admin (`admin_address`) after initiating an upgrade.

### Reset Gas (`resetGas`)
- **Opcode**: `0x42a0fb43`
- **Purpose**: Resets accumulated gas (TON) on the contract, refunding excess to the admin.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Result**: Sends any excess TON accumulated by the contract to the admin address.
- **Restrictions**: Can only be called by the admin (`admin_address`).

### Lock Contract (`lock`)
- **Opcode**: `0x878f9b0e`
- **Purpose**: Locks the router, preventing swap and liquidity provision operations.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Result**: Sets the `is_locked` flag in the contract state to `true`.
- **Restrictions**: Can only be called by the admin (`admin_address`).

### Unlock Contract (`unlock`)
- **Opcode**: `0x6ae4b0ef`
- **Purpose**: Unlocks the router, allowing swap and liquidity provision operations.
- **Parameters**: None.
- **Result**: Sets the `is_locked` flag in the contract state to `false`.
- **Restrictions**: Can only be called by the admin (`admin_address`).

### Collect Fees (`collectFees`)
- **Opcode**: `0x1fcb7d3d`
- **Purpose**: Requests the collection of accumulated fees from a specified pool.
- **Parameters**:
  - `jetton0Address` (Address): Wallet address of the first token in the pool.
  - `jetton1Address` (Address): Wallet address of the second token in the pool.
- **Result**: Sends a message to the pool to distribute accumulated fees (e.g., to the protocol and caller).
- **Restrictions**: Can be called by any user, provided the pool supports fee collection.

### Pay To (`payTo`)
- **Opcode**: `0xf93bb43f`
- **Purpose**: Facilitates token payouts from a pool to a user (e.g., after swaps, liquidity withdrawal, or refunds).
- **Parameters**:
  - `owner` (Address): Address of the recipient of the tokens.
  - `tokenAAmount` (BN): Amount of the first token to transfer (in nanotons).
  - `walletTokenAAddress` (Address): Wallet address of the first token.
  - `tokenBAmount` (BN): Amount of the second token to transfer (in nanotons).
  - `walletTokenBAddress` (Address): Wallet address of the second token.

### Get Pool Address (`getPoolAddress`)
- **Opcode**: `0xd1db969b`

## Usage Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `swap` function in TypeScript:

```typescript
import { beginCell, Address, BN } from "ton-core";
import { swap } from "./router";

const swapMsg = swap({
  jettonAmount: new BN(1000000000), // 1 TON in nanotons
  fromAddress: Address.parse("EQ...sender..."),
  walletTokenBAddress: Address.parse("EQ...tokenB..."),
  toAddress: Address.parse("EQ...recipient..."),
  expectedOutput: new BN(500000000), // 0.5 TON in nanotons
  refAddress: Address.parse("EQ...referral..."),
});

// Send `swapMsg` to the router contract via a TON client
